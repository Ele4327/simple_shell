# Simple Shell

Hello and Welcome to our Holberton Simple Shell project.
In this repository you will find our own simple shell, developed by software developers in progress.

For those who dont know a shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

For a more specific explanation, we invite you to see our manual: man_1_simple_shell

## Features

- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to

List of allowed functions and system calls:

- [ ] access
- [ ] chdir
- [ ] close
- [ ] closedir
- [ ] execve
- [ ] exit
- [ ] _exit
- [ ] fflush
- [ ] fork
- [ ] free
- [ ] getcwd
- [ ] getline
- [ ] getpid
- [ ] isatty
- [ ] kill
- [ ] malloc
- [ ] open
- [ ] opendir
- [ ] perror
- [ ] read
- [ ] readdir
- [ ] signal
- [ ] stat (__xstat)
- [ ] lstat (__lxstat)
- [ ] fstat (__fxstat)
- [ ] strtok
- [ ] wait
- [ ] waitpid
- [ ] wait3
- [ ] wait4
- [ ] write

## Output
Your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example SH:
```
Example of error with sh:
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
Same error with your program hsh:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
## Installation:
There is two ways: Compilation and Execution and Make
### Compilation and Execution:
Clone our repository:
- Go on your machine to the desired location and if you have git installed, type:
> git clone (link to this repository)
Once you have done this, go to the folder that is created, and just type:
> gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
And that¬¥s pretty much all, use the shell, like the standard shell.
### Make:
We know we told you that the code are compiled with gcc, but, if you dont have that
we thought that too
- Go on your machine to the desired location and if you have git installed, type:
> git clone (link to this repository)
Once you have done this, go to the folder that is created, and just type:
> make shelling_
With this you already can execute > .hsh
> make run
With this, execute the program as is
Now, you can skip that.
We have our own installator, with graphical menu and everything, to run it, just type:
> sudo ./sh-install.sh
Enter your password (if you have one), and do the step you want.
Of course, if you want dependences and all, but, we strongly recommend you, install the shell first, leave you the code here if you miss it:
> sudo ./sh-install.sh -i install
To execute, if you miss that too:
> sudo _shell -i run
And play and enjoy.
# How this works:

| `Builder.c` | Provides you with a function pointer to the executed command |
| `Builting.c` |  Function pointer checker |
| `Char_Func.c` |   String handling functions |
| `Char_Func2.c` |  String Handling Functions II |

## FlowChart:

## Tests
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```

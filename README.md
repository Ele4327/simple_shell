ðŸ‘‹ Hello Devs
# Simple Shell

Hello and Welcome to our Holberton Simple Shell project.
In this repository you will find our own simple shell, developed by software developers in progress.

For those who dont know a shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.

For a more specific explanation, we invite you to see our manual: man_1_simple_shell

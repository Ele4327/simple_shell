The shell is a command interpreter that acts as a messenger between the user and the core of the system

This shell is modularized in 3 folders:
simple shell, tests and manuals

In the simple shell we find the system calls, the main file
 and all the functions used in the shell are declared and defined, each with a purpose.

 In main.c is the PATH that contains a loop that iterates indefinitely, this is the one that receives each command entered by the user.
 
In the make file the alias are defined to compile different types of files, and with different rules:

shelling_ :
Compile the main file.

comp-holb-:
Compile the program with some flags requested by holerton, but allowing errors.

comp-holb_:
Compile the program with the flags requested by holberton.

chown:
Change permissions from root to user.

clean:
Delete junk files.

clean_tops:
Clear history and tmp files.

run:
Copy the hsh file to sbin and then run it
